<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an 18-year-old student who believes in growing through small, consistent improvements every day. I’m driven by curiosity and enjoy learning by building—whether it’s coding, solving problems, or creating something meaningful from scratch. I’m actively working on becoming fitter, sharpening my logical thinking through DSA, and developing strong frontend skills. I like structured routines, value discipline, and enjoy challenging myself through competitions, hackathons, and real-world projects. For me, progress matters more than perfection.</p>
